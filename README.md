# Simple-pathfinding-demo
This project presents a simple pathfinding demo where paths are determined using the A\* algorithm. The project allows users to set the start and end positions, place obstacles, and adjust the map size.


## Project
The start position is marked as a yellow tile, the end position as green, the path as blue, and obstacles are marked in red.
